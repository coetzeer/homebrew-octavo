# homebrew-octavo

A Homebrew tap — a small cellar of formulae and casks, brewed in octavo (eight leaves to the sheet, perfectly pocket-sized).

## Usage

```bash
brew tap coetzeer/homebrew-octavo
brew trust coetzeer/octavo   # brew 6+ refuses untrusted taps; do this once
brew install oh-my-bash
```

## Layout

- `Formula/` — Ruby formulae for command-line tools
- `Casks/` — casks for GUI apps (when needed)
