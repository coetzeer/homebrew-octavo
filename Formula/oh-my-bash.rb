  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Add Oh My Bash to your interactive shell by appending to ~/.bashrc:

        export OSH="#{opt_libexec}"
        source "$OSH/oh-my-bash.sh"

      Oh My Bash's built-in auto-updater expects a git checkout, which a
      Homebrew install is not. Add this line to ~/.bashrc to disable it and
      update via Homebrew instead (brew upgrade oh-my-bash):

        export DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=true

      Runtime caches and customisations are written under
      ~/.local/state/oh-my-bash and ~/.local/share/oh-my-bash rather than the
      read-only Cellar keg.
