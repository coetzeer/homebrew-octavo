    <<~EOS
      Add Oh My Fish to your fish shell by appending to ~/.config/fish/config.fish:

        set -gx OMF_PATH "#{opt_libexec}"
        source $OMF_PATH/init.fish

      Packages and themes installed with `omf install` land in
      $OMF_PATH/pkg, which is inside the brew-managed keg: they are removed
      by `brew upgrade oh-my-fish`. Reinstall your packages after upgrading,
      or install the framework with the upstream installer for a persistent
      setup outside Homebrew's control.
